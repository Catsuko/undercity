# Style Guide

Creative direction for Undercity world content.

## Theme & Vision

Gritty medieval fantasy in a post-apocalyptic setting. The world is ruined, abandoned, and hostile. Key references:

- **Berserk** - bleak, oppressive atmosphere; a world that grinds people down
- **Dark Souls** - decayed grandeur, cryptic history, loneliness
- **Between Two Fires** - medieval squalor, plague-ravaged landscapes, religious dread

## Tone

- The world is dead or dying. Civilization has collapsed.
- Nature and decay are reclaiming everything.
- History is implied through ruins, not explained through exposition.
- Dread over horror. Unease over shock.

## Block Descriptions

Each block description should:

1. **Identify what the place is** - a street, a tunnel, a burial ground, a tavern, etc.
2. **Include thematic detail** - gritty, sensory, grounded in the world's decay.

### Do

- Describe the physical space and its state of ruin.
- Use sensory detail: smell, texture, sound, dampness, rot.
- Imply history through what remains (faded banners, worn flagstones, scratched walls).
- Keep descriptions concise - two sentences is the sweet spot.

### Don't

- Don't reference other people in descriptions. The world is post-apocalyptic and a block may be empty.
- Don't describe lit torches, maintained roads, or anything that implies someone is keeping the place up.
- Don't name the undercity directly in descriptions. Keep them self-contained and vague enough to work if the map grows.
- Don't over-explain. "Something has scratched long grooves into the stone walls" is better than saying what did it.
